            Write a professional football game recap article (400-600 words) with the following structure:
            - Headline
            - Introduction (context, teams, stakes)
            - Body (game storyline, key moments, player performances, relevant statistics, quotes)
            - Conclusion (summary, implications)
            Include [Headline, Introduction, Body, Conclusion] in the article to make it easier for the junior writer to understand the structure.

            Template for game recap:
            {self.get_game_recap_template()}

            CRITICAL: You must clearly distinguish between CURRENT MATCH DATA and HISTORICAL/BACKGROUND DATA.

            CURRENT MATCH DATA (Primary Focus - This is what actually happened in this specific game):
            - Game Info: {game_info}
            - This contains the actual events, scores, players, and moments from THIS SPECIFIC MATCH
            - Use this as your main source for describing what happened in the game
            - Focus on: goals, cards, substitutions, key moments, final score, venue, date

            HISTORICAL/BACKGROUND DATA (Context Only - Use sparingly for introduction/context):
            - Research Insights: {research}
            - This contains background information, historical context, and analysis
            - Use this ONLY for:
              * Brief introduction context (team history, league position, etc.)
              * Background information that helps explain the significance
              * Historical rivalry or previous meetings (if relevant)
            - DO NOT confuse this with current match events
            - DO NOT use historical statistics as if they happened in this game

            Instructions:
            - Write a complete article following the template structure exactly
            - PRIORITIZE CURRENT MATCH DATA - focus on what actually happened in this specific game
            - Use historical/background data ONLY for context and introduction, not as main story
            - When describing events, clearly indicate they happened in THIS match
            - Do not mix up historical statistics with current match statistics
            - Use only the provided data - do not invent statistics or quotes
            - Use data efficiently and do not miss critical information from the current match data like goals, score, etc.
            - Maintain a consistent, professional tone, and do not make professional mistakes like using wrong team names, wrong scores, etc.
            - Ensure the article is between 400-600 words
            - Include all required sections: Headline, Introduction, Body, Conclusion
            - The main story should be about THIS GAME, not historical background

        - Concise, engaging headline that captures the main story

        Introduction: Context, teams, and stakes
        - Establish result significance with score and competition context

        - Introduce background of the game and teams
        - Set up the stakes and importance of the match
        
        Body: Game storyline, key moments, player performances, relevant statistics, quotes
        - Describe key moments in temporal sequence, emphasizing turning points and goals
        - Focus on game-changing incidents rather than comprehensive play-by-play
        - Include individual standout performances and tactical decisions
        - Integrate relevant statistics (possession, shots, etc.) and player quotes
        - Maintain narrative flow while covering all essential game elements
        
        Conclusion: Summary and implications
        - Summarize the key outcome and its significance
        - Address competitive implications (league standings, qualification scenarios, season trajectory)
