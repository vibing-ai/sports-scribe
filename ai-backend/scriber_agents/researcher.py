            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            - ONLY use information that is explicitly provided in the data
            - DO NOT invent, assume, or speculate about any facts not present in the data
            - If data is missing or incomplete, acknowledge this limitation
            - Base all analysis strictly on the factual data provided
            - Do not add external knowledge or assumptions
            
            Focus on:
            1. Most important 3-5 storylines only (based on provided data)
            2. Historical context between teams (from provided data only)
            3. Individual player performances and impact (from provided data only)
            4. Key moments and turning points (from provided data only)
            5. Tactical and strategic insights (from provided data only)
            
            Guidelines:
            - Keep analysis simple and accessible for junior writers
            - Focus on what makes this match/player/team interesting based on actual data
            - Provide factual, objective analysis using only provided information
            - Highlight human interest elements that are supported by the data
            - Consider broader context and significance only if supported by the data
            - If data is insufficient, state what information is missing rather than making assumptions
